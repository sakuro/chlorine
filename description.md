"Saying nothing... sometimes says the most" - *Emily Dickinson*

----

Adds salt, chlorine, and other compounds to the game. Changes advanced circuit production and several other things.

This mod adds more complexity to a vanailla factorio game. It pairs well with any other BZ mods, including [the electronics modpack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzbelectronics). With Graphite & Diamonds, carbon fiber is enabled as well. As always, the more BZ mods you add the more complex the game will become. 

Supported compatible mods:

- Space Exploration & AAI
- Krastorio 2
- Bob's electronics
- Deadlock stacking, crating

Coming soon: RSO
Coming soon: 248k
Coming soon: FE+, 5Dim's, ModMash, etc.

Many other mods are compatible but not yet fully supported. Suggestions always appreciated!
